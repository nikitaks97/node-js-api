        run: >
          curl -X POST http://app:3000/api/users  # here we use 3000 port as it is the port on which the app is exposed inside the container
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 
          -d '{"username": "hello","address": "dwded"}'

      # Send a GET request to retrieve all users
      - name: Get users
        run: curl http://app:3000/api/users

        #The app hostname only works between service containers and a job container (if defined with container:).Without that, the runner is outside the Docker network and can't resolve app â€” henc
# github actions automatically will make all the containers share the same docker network so all the ports are going to 
# be exposed between these containers so we donot need to map any port as we are communicating from a container to a container not
# from a host to a container. And we will communicate with the service container using its service name and not localhost.
